# gpt4all-experiments
Repo to train / inference different models with GPT4ALL dataset.

This repo is very much a WIP

Currently the following are available:

* hacked together training code for GPT-J and potentially GPT-NeoX
* inference code for GPT-J
* Model LoRA weights available here: [M-Chimiste/GPT-J-6B-GPT4ALL-SAMP-LORA-v1](https://huggingface.co/M-Chimiste/GPT-J-6B-GPT4ALL-SAMP-LORA-v1) (Current model is only trained on 50k samples of the GPT4ALL dataset as the full dataset would have taken over 5 days to train on my 2x 3090s.  Hopefully we can do this when I next go on vacation).
